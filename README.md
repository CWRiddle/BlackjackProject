### Lessons Learned
While making this blackjack game, I realized that the symbols for each of the suits of playing cards have unicode character equivalents. After finding this out, I set out to build a class that printed out graphical playing cards. In doing so, I learned a lot more about using StringBuilders. I had to strip down individual cards generated by a method and use StringBuilders to append the the rows of each deconstructed card to a collection of StringBuilders that held multiple rows of concatonated cards.
